# Annotation Tools and Scope

Few possibilities arise in this case of manual annotation. For complex cases, even manual annotation gets extremely tricky given the skewed ground truths.

Methods

* Manually Entering Points
* MATLAB ImageLabeler
* Azure CustomVision Smart Labeler Custom Annotation Service
* Python Image Labeler
* Other Private Software
* Finding a benchmarked method or algorithm that is axiomatic in its efficacy and using semi-supervised training to create an annotation to test on custom algorithms.
