# Contrastive Learning on MNIST, FMNIST and CIFAR-10 Datasets

## Points

* Working on SimCLR and NNCLR.
* Working on the underlying principles behind both models.
* Benchmarking the performance of SimCLR and NNCLR on the popular MNIST, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR-10 Datasets.
* Working on creating both models from scratch for creating intermediary outputs at each stage so as to retrieve valuable information.
